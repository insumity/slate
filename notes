The "Assymatry Matters" papers uses 2 programs from PARSEC: swaptions and streamcluster. They can be executed as follows:
/extra/parsec-3.0/bin/parsecmgmt -a run -p streamcluster -i simlarge -n A (with n = 5 takes about 22seconds)
/extra/parsec-3.0/bin/parsecmgmt -a run -p swaptions -i simlarge -n B (with n = 4 takes about 10 secons)
where A and B is the minimum amount of threads. Increasing them will increase the total execution time.
